# 🧪 Tomato Disease Detection with Object Detection Models

This project focuses on detecting **diseases on tomato leaves** using modern **object detection models** (YOLO series). The aim is to provide a lightweight and accurate solution for **agricultural diagnostics**, especially in **Vietnamese farming contexts**.

---

## 🍅 Dataset

We use a Vietnamese tomato leaf disease dataset annotated in YOLO format, with bounding boxes marking various disease regions on the leaves.

📁 **Dataset Kaggle Link:**  
👉 [Vietnamese Tomato Disease Dataset (YOLO format)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aresusayhi/vietnameses-tomato-disease-dataset)

**Classes include:**
- Leaf Curl Virus
- Yellow Leaf Curl Virus
- Healthy
- Mosaic Virus
- Late Blight
- Early Blight

## 📊 Goal

We aim to **compare performance** (accuracy, speed, model size) across the YOLO model families to determine the best-suited detector for **real-world deployment on edge devices** like smartphones or drones.
